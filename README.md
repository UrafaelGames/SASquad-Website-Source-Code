# SASquad-Website-Source-Code
Hi, I'm Urafael, member of SASquad Team, in this repository I have uploaded the next.js project of the website, so that everyone can read and analyze it, this is to have transparency and that everyone can see that we do not seek to put any kind of virus to our community.


To complement, and as the file is too large to put it all together here, we leave you the node_modules with the libraries used by the website: https://drive.google.com/file/d/108yuOkAE2MY_KBhevQbQSUjM_cGSlBVb/view?usp=drivesdk
